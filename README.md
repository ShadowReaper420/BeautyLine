# BeautyLine

This repository contains a copy of [BeautyLine](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1425426/), which source does not seem to be published anywhere else.

In addition, it contains a customized version of it that adds status icons for WiFi, Bluetooth and Volume control. I performed this customization and I am currently using this theme in my [NixOS](https://github.com/gvolpe/nix-config) machine.

You should be able to find this soon on Nixpkgs unstable under the attribute name `beauty-line-icon-theme`.
